          One week after the killing of George Floyd on the streets of
          Minneapolis, we decided to build our first product. 
          Crystal is a community curated database of US law enforcement officers and agencies. 
          By empowering citizens to contribute in addition to accessing data about their local police and law enforcement agencies, we envision Crystal
          becoming a trusted bedrock of transparent, accountable and collective law enforcement.

          The beta version of our open source app integrates existing public
          police officers' reports into a searchable database. We are displaying
          previous incidents of misconduct and cases where officers have been
          commended for outstanding performance.

          have a public-facing profile, which allows anyone to track
          praiseworthy moments and incidents of malpractice.

          Alongside Crystal, we are building:

              Mechanisms for communication, collaboration, and cooperation to
              allow interactions between police and the community

            <li>
              Automated accountability procedures and reporting to support
              communities in documenting their interactions with law enforcement

          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Crystal’s database has over 17,000 police records — most of which need
          to be community-vetted. There are more waiting to be uploaded, and we
          could use some help from the open-source community! Consider
